## Keyword Prioritization Heuristics

Score each candidate keyword from 1-5:

- Intent fit: Can this page satisfy the query cleanly?
- Conversion potential: Does the query indicate action/readiness?
- Differentiation: Can the page provide a unique angle or proof?
- Authority fit: Is the site likely to compete credibly?

Prefer keywords with strong business fit and intent fit over raw volume assumptions.
