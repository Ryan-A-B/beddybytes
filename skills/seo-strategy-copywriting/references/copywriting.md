## Landing / Service Page Skeleton

```md
# H1 (benefit + audience + topic)
1-2 sentence intro that confirms intent and outcome.

## Why [solution/topic] matters
- Problem symptoms
- Cost of inaction

## How [brand/service] helps
- Clear process or approach
- Differentiator(s)

## Benefits / outcomes
- Specific and concrete
- Tie to audience priorities

## Proof / trust
- Testimonials / metrics / case snippets / credentials

## FAQs
- Objections
- Timing
- Pricing/process expectations

## CTA
- Primary CTA
- Low-friction secondary CTA (optional)
```

## Blog Post Skeleton

```md
# H1
Hook + problem framing.

## Quick answer / summary
Give the core answer early when intent is informational.

## Main sections (H2/H3)
- Steps, comparisons, examples, or framework
- Use concise paragraphs and bullets

## Common mistakes / FAQs
- Address objections and edge cases

## Conclusion + next step
- Recap
- CTA / related resource
```

## Headline and Subhead Formulas

- `[Primary benefit] for [audience]`
- `How to [achieve outcome] without [pain point]`
- `[Number] ways to [desired outcome]`
- `[Topic]: What it is, how it works, and when to use it`
- `Get [outcome] with [method/service]`

Use formulas as a starting point, then make them specific to the user's offer and audience.

## CTA Formulas

- `Get a [deliverable]`
- `Book a [time-boxed action]`
- `See pricing`
- `Start [desired action]`
- `Talk to [role/team]`

Prefer concrete CTA labels over vague phrases like "Submit" or "Learn more" when the action is obvious.

## SEO Copy Editing Checklist

- Does the opening match likely intent within the first paragraph?
- Is the primary keyword used naturally in the H1 and early copy?
- Are headings descriptive and useful on their own?
- Is every section pulling toward the page goal?
- Are claims specific and supportable?
- Is the copy free of keyword stuffing and repetitive phrasing?
- Are FAQs answering real objections/questions?
- Is the CTA clear, visible, and aligned to intent?

## Rewrite Workflow (Existing Copy)

1. Keep the original goal and constraints visible.
2. Identify what is weak: intent mismatch, vagueness, redundancy, weak CTA, missing proof.
3. Preserve usable facts and proof points.
4. Rebuild structure first, then rewrite section-by-section.
5. Return a short changelog explaining the biggest improvements.
