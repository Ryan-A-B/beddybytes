                I probably shouldn't write this myself. One day if this project
                goes well I'll hire a lawyer who'll tell me all the things I've
                done wrong. But, if I'm going to claim that BeddyBytes is putting
                your family's privacy first, then you deserve better than a
                vague "we take your privacy seriously" message.

                        We collect your email address for account management and

                    If you voluntarily provide personal information to us directly,

                    keeping it for as long necessary for the stated purpose, and we
                    will protect it by keeping it secure and deleting it when it is
                    no longer required, unless a longer period is required by law.

                    Similarly, if you reach out to us directly for support, to
                    provide feedback (such as in a crash report) or for other
                    reasons, we will only use your contact information to respond to

                    the software-as-a-service providers we use in our corporate
                    systems (such as our company email and project management
