        <h1>Do I Need a Baby Monitor?</h1>
        <p>
            When my wife and I were expecting our first child, we were
            bombarded with recommendations on what we should buy. From fancy
            bassinets that rock your baby to sleep to bottle warmers that could
            be controlled by an app, it seemed like there was a gadget for
            every possible parenting need. One item that consistently appeared
            at the top of every list was the baby monitor. And not just any
            baby monitor—oh no, it had to have video, night vision, two-way
            audio, sleep analytics, temperature sensors, and a 5-inch HD
            screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, here's the thing: you don't need a baby monitor. If your home
            is small enough that you're always in earshot, you might not even
            want one. But let me explain why it might still be worth
            considering.
        </p>

            In the early days of parenthood, it's easy to feel like you need to
            be hyper-aware of every little sound your baby makes. You're trying
            to decipher every cry and coo, and the idea of having a little
            device that lets you keep tabs on them while you're in another room
            seems like a no-brainer. But let's not forget the purpose of a baby
            monitor: it's there to give you peace of mind, not to create more
            anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we first brought our daughter home, we didn't have a monitor.
            My wife and I made sure that one of us was always in the room with
            her. We worked our way up to both of us leaving the room for short
            periods of time. We would play pranks on each other, moving our
            daughter while the other was out of the room. Then, we levelled up
            to being in the next room while our daughter slept. Finally, my
            wife stated the obvious; we needed a baby monitor. It felt like we
            had a leash attached to us, keeping us within earshot of our
            daughter, and making tasks as simple as hanging washing on the line
            outside feel difficult while she slept.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using BeddyBytes has been great for us, particularly for daytime
            naps and when we travel. For daytime naps it's great to be able to
            move around. By using one of our phones as the parent station
            station, we feel secure enough to go outside and hang the washing
            out or do some cooking in the kitchen. Being able to access it from
            our computers is great as well. As I write this I have BeddyBytes
            open on my second monitor. My daughter is now two years old and
            fighting her midday nap. This afternoon will be interesting...
            In the meantime, I'm watching her sing to herself while I get some
            work done.
        </p>
        <p>
            BeddyBytes has also been great for when we go and stay at my wife's
            parents place. They have split floors and we certainly wouldn't
            feel comfortable letting our daughter downstairs by herself without
            being able to at least listen.
        </p>

            So, do you need a baby monitor? No, you don't. You can absolutely
            raise a happy, healthy child without one. But if you're someone who
            values that extra bit of reassurance, or if your living situation
            makes it difficult to hear your baby from another room, a monitor
            can be a helpful tool in your parenting arsenal.
        </p>
        <p>
            The key is to use it as intended: a tool to help, not a crutch that
            feeds your anxieties. We've found a balance that works for us,
            using the monitor selectively and focusing more on establishing
            routines and creating a peaceful environment for our daughter to
            sleep in. Because at the end of the day, it's those routines and
            rituals that will provide the foundation your child needs to
            thrive—not the latest gadget. And if you decide you do want or need
            a baby monitor, try the baby monitor that prioritises your family's
            privacy above all other gimmicks: BeddyBytes.
