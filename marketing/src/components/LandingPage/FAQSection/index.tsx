                    BeddyBytes uses WebRTC to send video directly between your devices.
                    To start a WebRTC connection your devices first need to find each other.
                    The easiest way to do this is to use a remote server.
                    None of the data exchanged between your devices is stored.
                    The data is nearly worthless outside of your home WiFi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future we plan to add the ability to connect without an internet connection.

        question: "What's the value over a baby monitor I can buy at the shops?",
        answer: (
            <React.Fragment>
                <p>
                    Well, first of all you don't need to leave the couch! But, on a more serious note,
                    BeddyBytes provides privacy and convenience. By creating an app which sends your
                    data directly between devices and only on your home WiFi, we greatly reduce any
                    possibility of unwanted access. Add a log in and encryption, and you're looking like
                    a pretty tough nut to crack. On the convenience front it's hard to overstate how nice
                    it is to pull up the monitor on my phone while we're having lunch and then bring it up
                    on my laptop when I go to my office.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BeddyBytes is also perfect for travel, most of us already travel with at least 2 devices,
                    which means you have everything you need. No need to stuff another thing into your
                    already overflowing baby travel bag. Which also means one less thing to forget! We've got
                    enough on our minds.

            <p>
                BeddyBytes uses WebRTC to stream video and audio directly between your devices.
                We don't store any of your video on our servers.
            </p>

    },
    {
        question: 'Why does the password need to be so long?',
        answer: (
            <p>
                Apparently not everyone appreciates a strong (20+ characters) password as much as I do.
                I'll reduce the minimum length and later replace the password login.
            </p>

        question: 'Does it have night vision?',
        answer: (
            <p>
                Sadly, most smartphone cameras don't have a night vision camera. But there is an audio only mode which we use every night.
